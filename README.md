# Frequently Asked Questions

1. I receive an "UI not found" error when running the app:
 
     This happens when only part of the .zip folder is extracted. In windows machines when you double click on a .zip file the contents of the file are shown but not extracted. You have to click "Extract all" and then navigate to the extracted folder to open the .Rproj file.

2. I see an error about package versions not matching the expected version:     
    
   This happens when the R version is not updated to the lates version. To fix this issue you need to install R again. You can do so on this page:          https://www.r-project.org/
